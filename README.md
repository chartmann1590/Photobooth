```

Then restart the hotspot:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart hostapd dnsmasq
```

### Customize PhotoBooth Settings

Edit `/opt/photobooth/.env`:
```bash
# Security
SETTINGS_PASSWORD=your-admin-password

# Photo Quality (balance quality vs RPi 3B performance)
PHOTO_WIDTH=1800
PHOTO_HEIGHT=1200
PHOTO_QUALITY=85

# Printing
PRINT_PAPER_SIZE=4x6
PRINT_DPI=300

# Audio/TTS
TTS_ENABLED=true
TTS_VOICE=en+f3
TTS_RATE=150
```

Then restart the application:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart photobooth
```

### USB Printer Setup

1. **Connect printer via USB** to Raspberry Pi
2. **Auto-detection**: Most printers are detected automatically
3. **Manual setup** (if needed):
   - Access CUPS at `http://192.168.50.1:631`
   - Administration → Add Printer
   - Follow the setup wizard
4. **Configure in PhotoBooth**:
   - Go to Settings → Printer
   - Select default printer
   - Run test print

**Tested printer types:**
- **Canon SELPHY** CP series (photo printers)
- **HP DeskJet** series with photo paper
- **Epson** photo and inkjet printers
- Most USB printers with Linux drivers

### Custom Frame Overlays

Create wedding-branded frames:

**Requirements:**
- **Format:** PNG with transparency
- **Size:** 1800×1200 pixels (matches photo dimensions)
- **Design areas:** Transparent center for photo, decorated borders

**Design tips:**
- Use wedding colors and theme
- Include couple names and date
- Add venue name or hashtag
- Keep center area clear for faces
- Test transparency on sample photos

**Upload via Settings → Frame section**

### SMS Photo Sharing Setup

Enable guests to share photos instantly via SMS:

**Prerequisites:**
- **Android device** (phone/tablet) with SMS capability
- **SMS-Gate app** installed from [SMS-Gate releases](https://github.com/capcom6/sms-gate/releases)
- **Same network** as PhotoBooth system

**Quick Setup:**
1. **Install SMS-Gate** on Android device
2. **Configure SMS-Gate server** and note IP address
3. **Access PhotoBooth Settings** → SMS section
4. **Enter gateway details**:
   - Host/IP: `192.168.50.XXX:8080` (SMS-Gate device IP)
   - Username/Password: As configured in SMS-Gate
5. **Test connection** using built-in test button

**How it works:**
- After taking a photo, guests see three options: Print, Send SMS, or Retake
- Guests click "Send SMS" to share the photo instantly
- Photo uploads to [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/) (free, 24-hour hosting)
- SMS sent with photo URL via local SMS-Gate server
- No external SMS services or fees required
- Also available from admin gallery for any saved photo

**Documentation:** See `docs/sms_photo_sharing.md` for complete setup guide

### Immich Photo Backup Setup

Automate photo backup to your personal cloud:

**Prerequisites:**
- **Immich server** running on your network ([installation guide](https://immich.app/docs/install/requirements))
- **API key** generated from your Immich user settings
- **Network access** from PhotoBooth to Immich server

**Quick Setup:**
1. **Set up Immich server** following [official documentation](https://immich.app/docs/install/requirements)
2. **Generate API key** in Immich user settings
3. **Access PhotoBooth Settings** → Gallery section → Immich Sync (click to expand)
4. **Configure connection**:
   - Server URL: `https://your-immich-server.com`
   - API Key: Your generated key
   - Album Name: `PhotoBooth` (or custom name)
5. **Test connection** and enable sync options

**How it works:**
- Photos automatically sync to Immich after capture (if enabled)
- Creates specified album automatically if it doesn't exist
- Detects and skips duplicate photos using checksums
- Bulk sync available for existing photo libraries
- All sync operations happen in background
- No external cloud services - uses your own Immich server

**Documentation:** See `docs/immich_sync.md` for detailed configuration guide

## 🛠️ System Management

### Service Control

**Main PhotoBooth service:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start photobooth    # Start
sudo systemctl stop photobooth     # Stop
sudo systemctl restart photobooth  # Restart
sudo systemctl status photobooth   # Check status
```

**All related services:**
```bash
# Start all services
sudo systemctl start photobooth nginx hostapd dnsmasq cups

# Check status of all services
sudo systemctl status photobooth nginx hostapd dnsmasq
```

### Logs and Monitoring

```bash
# PhotoBooth application logs
tail -f /opt/photobooth/photobooth.log

# System service logs
sudo journalctl -u photobooth -f
sudo journalctl -u hostapd -f
sudo journalctl -u nginx -f

# Check disk space
df -h
```

### Performance Optimization

**For Raspberry Pi 3B:**

1. **Increase GPU memory:**
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   # Advanced Options → Memory Split → 128
   ```

2. **Disable unnecessary services:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl disable bluetooth
   sudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon
   ```

### Backup Important Data

```bash
# Backup photos
sudo cp -r /opt/photobooth/data/photos /your-backup-location/

# Backup configuration
sudo cp /opt/photobooth/.env /your-backup-location/
sudo cp /opt/photobooth/data/photobooth.db /your-backup-location/
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Camera Access Issues

**iOS Safari (most important):**
1. Connect to WiFi network
2. Go to `https://192.168.50.1/`
3. Trust certificate when prompted (Settings → General → VPN & Device Management)
4. Return to Safari and allow camera access
5. Use full-screen mode for best experience

**Android Chrome:**
1. Accept certificate warning when prompted
2. Allow camera access in browser permissions
3. Ensure microphone isn't blocking camera

**General tips:**
- **HTTPS is required** for camera access (never use HTTP)
- Camera requires **user gesture** (button tap) to activate
- Try different browsers if issues persist

### Printer Issues

**Printer not detected:**
```bash
# Check USB connection
lsusb

# Check CUPS status
sudo systemctl status cups
lpstat -p

# Restart CUPS
sudo systemctl restart cups
```

**Manual printer setup:**
1. Access CUPS web interface: `http://192.168.50.1:631`
2. Administration → Add Printer
3. Follow setup wizard
4. Test print from PhotoBooth settings

### WiFi Hotspot Issues

**Hotspot not broadcasting:**
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status hostapd dnsmasq

# Check WiFi interface
iwconfig wlan0

# Restart hotspot services
sudo systemctl restart hostapd dnsmasq

# Unblock WiFi if needed
sudo rfkill unblock wlan
```

**Clients can't connect:**
```bash
# Check DHCP lease file
cat /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases

# Restart networking
sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd
```

### Performance Issues

**Photos loading slowly:**
- Reduce `PHOTO_QUALITY` in `.env` (try 75 instead of 85)
- Increase GPU memory split to 128MB
- Use faster microSD card (Class 10 or better)

**General slowness:**
```bash
# Check system resources
htop
df -h

# Disable unnecessary services
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth avahi-daemon
```
