```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Connection Failed" Error

**Symptoms**: Test connection fails, photos not syncing

**Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Network connectivity**:
   - Check if server is reachable: `ping your-immich-server.com`
   - Verify firewall rules allow outbound connections
   - Test with curl: `curl -I https://your-immich-server.com`

2. **Wrong server URL**:
   - Include protocol: `https://` or `http://`
   - Include port if non-standard: `:2283`
   - Check for typos in domain/IP

3. **Invalid API key**:
   - Regenerate API key in Immich settings
   - Ensure key is copied completely (no spaces)
   - Check if user account has proper permissions

#### "Album Creation Failed" Error

**Symptoms**: Photos upload but aren't added to album

**Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Duplicate album names**:
   - Album with same name exists but is owned by different user
   - Use unique album name or check existing albums

2. **Permissions issue**:
   - API key user doesn't have album creation rights
   - Use admin API key or grant appropriate permissions

3. **Special characters**:
   - Album name contains unsupported characters
   - Use alphanumeric names with spaces/hyphens only

#### "Photos Not Syncing" Issue

**Symptoms**: Settings look correct but sync doesn't happen

**Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Sync disabled**:
   - Check "Enable Immich Sync" is checked
   - Verify "Sync on Capture" if expecting real-time sync

2. **File permissions**:
   - Ensure PhotoBooth can read photo files
   - Check `/opt/photobooth/data/photos/all/` permissions

3. **Network issues**:
   - Intermittent connectivity problems
   - Check logs for timeout errors
   - Consider increasing timeout values

#### "Duplicate Detection" Confusion

**Symptoms**: Photos appear multiple times or sync reports duplicates

**Understanding**:
- Immich uses SHA1 checksums to detect duplicates
- Same photo uploaded twice = 1 duplicate, 1 skipped
- Different photos with same name = 2 separate uploads
- This is normal and expected behavior

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```python
# In PhotoBooth console
import logging
logging.getLogger('photobooth.immich').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### Log Analysis

Important log messages to look for:

```bash
# Successful connection
grep "Connection to Immich server successful" /opt/photobooth/photobooth.log

# Album creation
grep "Created Immich album" /opt/photobooth/photobooth.log

# Photo uploads
grep "Uploaded photo.*to Immich" /opt/photobooth/photobooth.log

# Errors
grep "ERROR.*immich" /opt/photobooth/photobooth.log
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### API Key Security

- **Store securely**: API keys are stored in database, not plain text files
- **Rotate regularly**: Generate new keys periodically
- **Limit permissions**: Create dedicated user with minimal required permissions
- **Monitor usage**: Check Immich logs for unexpected API activity

### Network Security

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use encrypted connections for remote servers
- **VPN access**: Consider VPN for remote Immich servers
- **Firewall rules**: Limit outbound connections to only necessary ports
- **Private networks**: Keep Immich on private networks when possible

### Privacy Considerations

- **Self-hosted**: Photos stay on your infrastructure
- **No third parties**: Direct connection, no external services
- **Access control**: Manage who can access your Immich server
- **Backup policies**: Immich becomes another backup location, not replacement

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### Upload Performance

**Network optimization**:
- Use wired ethernet for PhotoBooth Pi when possible
- Consider 5GHz WiFi if Pi supports it (Pi 4+ only)
- Position Pi close to router for strong signal

**Server optimization**:
- Use SSD storage for Immich database
- Adequate RAM for Immich containers
- Consider geographic proximity for cloud servers

### Resource Management

**PhotoBooth Pi resources**:
- Sync operations use minimal CPU (background threads)
- Network usage peaks during uploads (~2MB per photo)
- No significant memory impact

**Monitoring**:
```bash
# Check system resources during sync
htop
iotop
nethogs
```

## üìä Sync Statistics & Monitoring

### Built-in Monitoring

The PhotoBooth interface provides:
- **Connection status**: Green/red indicator
- **Last sync time**: When last photo was uploaded
- **Sync success/failure counts**: Basic statistics
- **Album information**: Current album details

### Advanced Monitoring

**Immich server metrics**:
- Check Immich admin dashboard for storage usage
- Monitor API usage in Immich logs
- Track album growth and photo counts

**PhotoBooth logs analysis**:
```bash
# Count successful uploads today
grep "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')" /opt/photobooth/photobooth.log | grep "Uploaded photo.*to Immich" | wc -l

# Check for recent errors
grep "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')" /opt/photobooth/photobooth.log | grep -i "error.*immich"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Backup & Recovery

### PhotoBooth Backup

**Critical settings to backup**:
- Database: `/opt/photobooth/data/photobooth.db`
- Configuration: `/opt/photobooth/.env`
- Photos: `/opt/photobooth/data/photos/`

**Backup command**:
```bash
tar -czf photobooth-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
  /opt/photobooth/data/ \
  /opt/photobooth/.env
```

### Immich Server Backup

Follow [Immich backup documentation](https://immich.app/docs/administration/backup-and-restore):

```bash
# Backup Immich database
docker-compose exec database pg_dump -U postgres immich > immich-db-backup.sql

# Backup uploaded photos
cp -r /path/to/immich/upload /backup/location/
```

### Recovery Scenarios

**Scenario 1: PhotoBooth failure**
- Restore from backup
- Reconfigure Immich settings
- Photos already safely stored in Immich

**Scenario 2: Immich server failure**
- Photos remain on PhotoBooth Pi
- Re-sync after Immich restoration
- Duplicate detection prevents re-upload issues

## üéØ Best Practices

### Pre-Event Setup

1. **Test thoroughly** at least 1 week before event
2. **Verify album creation** with test photos
3. **Check network stability** with sustained uploads
4. **Monitor resource usage** during test runs
5. **Have fallback plan** if sync fails during event

### Event Day Operations

1. **Enable real-time sync** for automatic backup
2. **Monitor connection status** periodically
3. **Check storage space** on both PhotoBooth and Immich
4. **Have backup storage** ready (USB drive, etc.)
5. **Don't rely solely on sync** - local photos are primary

### Post-Event Management

1. **Verify all photos synced** using bulk sync feature
2. **Organize albums** on Immich server as needed
3. **Share access** with couple/family as appropriate
4. **Create backups** of both systems
5. **Document sync statistics** for future events

## üîó Integration Examples

### Wedding Photographer Workflow

```python
# Custom script for photographer integration
from photobooth.immich import get_immich_sync

sync = get_immich_sync()
result = sync.sync_all_photos('/path/to/photographer/selects')
print(f"Synced {result['uploaded']} professional photos")
```

### Multi-Event Management

```bash
# Change album name for different events
# Via web interface or database update
sqlite3 /opt/photobooth/data/photobooth.db \
  "UPDATE settings SET value='Birthday2024' WHERE key='immich_album_name'"
```

### API Integration

**Custom sync triggers**:
```python
# Sync specific photo programmatically
from photobooth.immich import sync_photo_to_immich

result = sync_photo_to_immich('/path/to/special/photo.jpg')
if result['success']:
    print("Photo synced successfully!")
```
